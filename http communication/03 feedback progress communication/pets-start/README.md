# In this demo we are going to observe progress of http requests. 

* We have created a new endpoint server, where the files will be placed.
* This new endpoint it's created with `multer`

```javascript
app.post('/api/v1/pets/:id/image', upload.single('image'), (_, res) => {
  res.send(res.file);
});
```
* Also we have created a new entry that will allow us upload a file.
